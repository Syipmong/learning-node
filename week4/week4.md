Reflection for Week 4: Building REST APIs
Topics Covered:

Understanding REST: Key principles of REST and HTTP methods used for CRUD operations.
Setting up an API with Express: Created a simple API structure using Express.
CRUD Operations: Implemented full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user data.
Error Handling: Handled errors with proper status codes and messages.
Testing with Postman: Used Postman to test the API routes and verify the functionality.
Key Learnings:

RESTful architecture is the backbone of many modern web applications, allowing clients and servers to communicate effectively.
Express makes it simple to implement API routes, handle requests, and send back appropriate responses.
Error handling is crucial for building robust APIs that can deal with invalid inputs or unexpected issues.
