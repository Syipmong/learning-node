Week 1: Node.js Setup and Basics
Topics Covered:

Installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
Learned how to check Node.js and npm versions.
Wrote the first Node.js script and explored the basics of Nodeâ€™s REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
Worked with the core fs (File System) module to read and write files synchronously and asynchronously.
Experimented with global objects such as __dirname, __filename, and process.

Key Learnings:

Node.js allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser, making it possible to build server-side applications using JavaScript.
The require() function is used to import modules, like the fs module, which interacts with the file system.
Node.js uses an asynchronous, non-blocking model, which makes it very efficient for I/O operations, but requires understanding of callbacks, promises, and async/await.
The difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations is crucial for performance in larger applications.
Practical Exercise:

Created a simple script to write a message to a file and read it asynchronously.
