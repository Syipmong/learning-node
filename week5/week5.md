# Week 5 Goals

Introduction to Databases: Understanding the basics of databases (SQL vs NoSQL).
Setting Up MongoDB: Connecting Node.js to MongoDB.
CRUD Operations with MongoDB: Performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in MongoDB using Mongoose.
Handling Errors and Validation: Implementing validation and handling errors.
Exploring SQL (Optional): Introduction to SQL and how to work with databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL if you prefer SQL.

## Introduction to Databases (SQL vs NoSQL)

### SQL vs NoSQL

1.1 SQL Databases:
Relational: Data is organized into tables (rows and columns).
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.
Structured Data: Requires a schema (predefined structure) for the data.
When to Use: When relationships between entities are important, or when complex queries and transactions are needed.
1.2 NoSQL Databases:
Non-relational: Data is stored in collections, usually in JSON-like documents.
Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
Flexible Schema: No fixed schema, making it ideal for rapidly evolving data structures.
When to Use: When you need high scalability or are working with large volumes of unstructured data.
Since MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases and pairs well with Node.js, we will focus on MongoDB in this session.
