Reflection for Week 3: Express.js Basics
Topics Covered:

Setting up Express: Installed and initialized a basic Express app.
Routing: Defined routes and handled different paths for GET and POST requests.
Middleware: Learned about middleware, both custom and built-in, and its role in the request-response cycle.
Handling POST Requests: Handled form data and JSON using body-parser.
Serving Static Files and HTML: Served static files like CSS or images, and used res.sendFile() to serve an HTML page.
Key Learnings:

Express simplifies the process of building servers with cleaner and more maintainable code.
Middleware is a powerful tool to modify requests/responses, handle logging, authentication, and much more.
Routing and handling different HTTP methods (like GET and POST) are at the core of web development.
Serving static content and HTML pages is easy with Express, which makes it great for both APIs and traditional web apps.
